# Team Diffusion Repository. GCD Project III 22/23

## This repository covers the Anomalous Diffusion Patterns modelling project. 

## About

The Anomalous Diffusion Patterns project is built under the scope of the AnDi Challenge 2021.

The AnDi Challenge consisted of 3 tasks, each of them covering a matter of interest for the study of anomalous diffusion. This project focuses on the third of the proposed challenges, which aimes to develop state-of-the-art methodologieschangepoint detection

The documentation used can be found to and task-specific documentation and references can be found in task specific folders (refer to [Task1](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task1), [Task2](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task2) and [Task3](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task3)).

## Data

Data generation was a key part of the project, the instructions for generating synthetic data for the tasks can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/data) folder. There it can be found Python notebooks that can help you to create synthetic data for the AnDi Challenge Sub-Tasks. The same way, trajectory exploration notebooks can be found as well.

## Models 

Specifications for the models can be found in the [Lista](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Lista) folder, containing .h5 files with pre-trained models for AnDi specific tasks. The same way, code to deliver predictions following this project's approach for AnDi Challenge's Task 3 is available as well.
