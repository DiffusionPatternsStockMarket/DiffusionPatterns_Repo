## This repository covers the Anomalous Diffusion Patterns modelling project. 

## About

The AnDi Challenge consisted of 3 tasks, each of them covering a matter of interest for the study of anomalous diffusion. This project focuses

The documentation used can be found in Heuristics and task-specific docs can be found in task specific folders.

## Data

Data generation was a key part of the project, the instructions for generating synthetic data for the tasks can be found in the data folder, also understanding_data is available in the same folder, which explains the differences between movement types and alpha differences in same types of movement.

## Models 

Specifications for the models can be found in the Lista folder, containing .h5 files with pre-trained models for AnDi specific tasks. In this folder you can also find the predictions from the models and its respective evaluations.
