## This repository covers the Anomalous Diffusion Patterns project. 

## About

The Anomalous Diffusion Patterns project is built under the scope of the AnDI CHallenge.

Team Members:

Evgeny Grachev
Xinhui Huang-Chen
Constantino Mart√≠nez
Antonio P√©rez
Pablo S√°nchez
Jinhao Zhang Guo


The AnDi Challenge consisted of 3 tasks, each of them covering a matter of interest for the study of anomalous diffusion. 

The first task consisted of estimating an ùù∞ value that drives the level of diffusion.
The second task consists of brownian motion classification
The third task consisted of identifying a chengepoint in the series.

The documentation used can be found in Heuristics and task-specific docs can be found in task specific folders.

## Data

Data generation was a key part of the project, the instructions for generating synthetic data for the tasks can be found in the data folder, also understanding_data is available in the same folder, which explains the differences between movement types and alpha differences in same types of movement.

## Models 

Specification for the models can be found in the Lista folder, containing .h5 files with model hyperparameters. In this folder you can also find the predictions from the models and its respective evaluations.
