## This repository covers the Anomalous Diffusion Patterns project. 

## About

The Anomalous Diffusion Patterns project is built under the scope of the AnDI CHallenge 

The AnDi Challenge consisted of 3 tasks, each of them covering a matter of interest for the study of anomalous diffusion. These tasks consisted on estimating an alpha parameter, walker classification and change-point identification.

The documentation used can be found in Heuristics and task-specific docs can be found in task specific files.

## Data

Data generation was a key part of the project, the instructions for generating synthetic data for the tasks can be found in the data folder, also understanding_data is available in the same folder, which explains the differences between movement types and alpha differences in same types of movement.

## Models 

Specification for the models can be found in the
