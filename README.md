# Team Diffusion Repository. GCD Project III 22/23

## About

This repository covers the Anomalous Diffusion Patterns modelling project. This project is built under the scope of the AnDi Challenge 2021. It has been developed by Team 03 from Project III course from UPV Data Science Degree.

The [AnDi Challenge](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/LaBiblia.pdf) consisted of 3 tasks, each of them covering a matter of interest for the study of anomalous diffusion. This project focuses on the third of the proposed challenges, which aimes to develop state-of-the-art methodologies for changepoint detection

The documentation used can be found to and task-specific documentation and references can be found in task specific folders (refer to [Task1](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task1), [Task2](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task2) and [Task3](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Task3)).

## Data

Data generation was a key part of the project, the instructions for generating synthetic data for the tasks can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/data) folder. There it can be found Python notebooks that can help you to create synthetic data for the AnDi Challenge Sub-Tasks. The same way, trajectory exploration notebooks can be found as well.

## Models 

Specifications for the models can be found in the [Lista](https://github.com/DiffusionPatternsStockMarket/DiffusionPatterns_Repo/tree/main/Lista) folder, containing .h5 files with pre-trained models for AnDi specific tasks. The same way, code to deliver predictions following this project's approach for AnDi Challenge's Task 3 is available as well.
