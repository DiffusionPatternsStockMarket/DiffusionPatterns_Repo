# TASK 1

The first task consisted in inferring the 𝝰 exponent of a given tracer path which contains noise, so we would be talking about a regression task; the second, to classify a determined trajectory considering up to 5 variations/archetypes of brownian motions.


The explored space by a brownian walkers can be described by the MSD (Mean Squared Trajectory Displacement) which increases in time following an asymptotic power law dependence (MSD ∝ T𝝰) and divides variants of brownian motion in three regimes (subdiffusive (𝝰 < 1.0) , superdiffusive (1.0 < 𝝰 < 2.0) and diffusive which is equivalent to brownian motion (𝝰 = 1.0)
