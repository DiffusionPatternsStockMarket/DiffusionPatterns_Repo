TASK 1

The first task consisted in inferring the ùù∞ exponent of a given tracer path which contains noise, so we would be talking about a regression task; the second, to classify a determined trajectory considering up to 5 variations/archetypes of brownian motions.

CTRW (Continuous time random walk); characterized by behavior on the walker (particle, DNA or protein chains, stock prices...) that consists in waiting times (that can be modeled as an stochastic process) between each walker movement in whatever dimension.
